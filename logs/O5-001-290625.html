<h3>The Prelude</h3>
<p align="center">
    The clock struck 6 a.m., its chime echoing faintly through the still, sterile halls of Site-0. The early hours were the Foundation’s most tranquil, a rare calm in an otherwise chaotic bastion of secrecy and anomalies. Yet, as the facility lay in a deceptive peace, unseen forces were already stirring.
    <br><br>
    Dr. Yeva Bright sat in her quarters, a single desk lamp casting long, flickering shadows across the room. Papers were strewn across her desk: medical logs, psychological assessments, and encrypted memos she wasn’t technically authorized to read but had intercepted out of necessity. The soft hum of the overhead ventilation was the only sound accompanying her racing thoughts.
    <br><br>
    She knew something was coming.
    <br><br>
    For weeks now, the cracks in the Foundation’s rigid structure had begun to show. Meetings she wasn’t invited to, personnel transfers without explanation, and whispers in the corridors that silenced the moment she entered. Even her brother Jack had gone silent—an unprecedented lapse in their otherwise frequent communications.
    <br><br>
    And then, the document had appeared on her personal terminal.
</p>

<p align="center">
    It was a routine evening three days earlier. Yeva had been running late, as usual, tending to a particularly obstinate instance of SCP-049’s reanimated plague victims. She returned to her office expecting to catch up on overdue reports, only to find her terminal unlocked.
    <br><br>
    <b class="terminal">ProphetOS~: "ACCESS GRANTED: SECURITY CLASS 5 CLEARANCE"</b>
    <br><br>
    Yeva’s heart skipped a beat. Level 5 access was reserved for the O5 Council and select department heads. She glanced around her office, the hair on the back of her neck standing on end. No one had been here.
    <br><br>
    Curiosity overrode caution. She sat down and scanned the open file.
    <br><br>
    It was her personnel dossier—her entire Foundation career laid bare in excruciating detail. Her accomplishments were meticulously cataloged: breakthroughs in anomalous medicine, innovations in SCP containment procedures, and her tenure as Chairwoman of the O5 Council. But as she scrolled further, her stomach sank.
    <br><br>
    The final section was titled: "ONGOING INVESTIGATION – INTERNAL SECURITY SERVICES"
    <br><br>
    Beneath it was a single line of text:
    <br><br>
    <a class="terminal">"Subject: Dr. Yeva Bright – Allegations of High Treason Against the SCP Foundation"</a>
    <br><br>
    Her breath caught in her throat.
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "What in the world...?"
    <small>— Yeva (to herself)</small>
</div>

<p align="center">
    The accusations were vague but damning: misuse of resources, unauthorized interactions with anomalies, and—most disturbingly—collaboration with external groups. She leaned back in her chair, the enormity of the situation crashing down on her.
    <br><br>
    Someone was setting her up.
</p>

<p align="center">
    The days that followed were a blur. Yeva worked with a growing sense of paranoia, her every action scrutinized under a microscope. She noticed the subtle shifts: once-friendly colleagues now avoided eye contact, and casual conversations seemed laced with hidden meanings.
    <br><br>
    Desperate for answers, she tried to reach out to Jack, hoping his unique position and intellect could help her untangle the conspiracy. But her brother was unreachable, likely submerged in some otherworldly crisis or ensnared in the bureaucratic nightmare of his own existence as SCP-963’s reluctant host.
    <br><br>
    The more she delved into her situation, the more she realized how little control she had. The Foundation had always been a machine, grinding forward without pause, and she had always been a cog in its mechanisms. But now, it seemed the machine had turned against her.
</p>

<p align="center">
    On the third night, Yeva received an untraceable message. The source was unknown, but the sender’s voice was unmistakable: Dr. Sophia Light, her former colleague and one of the few people Yeva trusted implicitly.
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "Yeva, listen to me. They’re coming for you. I don’t know when, but it’ll be soon. The ISS is involved, and they’re working under direct orders from the Council. You have to leave. Now."
    <small>— Sophia’s Voice (Audio Recording)</small>
</div>

<p align="center">
    Yeva stared at her terminal, her pulse quickening. She knew Sophia wouldn’t contact her unless the threat was real.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "Sophia, where would I even go? There’s nowhere they won’t find me."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "You’re resourceful, Yeva. You’ve faced worse than this. But if you stay, they’ll make you disappear. You know what happens to people the ISS takes."
    <small>— Sophia</small>
</div>

<p align="center">
    Yeva closed her eyes, the weight of Sophia’s words settling over her.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Despite the warning, Yeva couldn’t bring herself to run. Not yet. There were too many unanswered questions, too many loose ends. And above all, she couldn’t abandon SCP-682, the creature she had spent years trying to understand and protect.
    <br><br>
    In the days leading up to her arrest, she began quietly transferring encrypted files to an external drive. If she was going down, she wouldn’t go down without a fight. She also began leaving subtle breadcrumbs for Jack, hoping that he would eventually notice her plight and intervene.
    <br><br>
    Meanwhile, the ISS strike team, led by Jaxion Alexander, was making its final preparations.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Jaxion Alexander wasn’t new to difficult missions. As a former Command Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army, he had seen his fair share of high-stakes operations. But this one felt different.
    <br><br>
    Sitting in the briefing room, he couldn’t shake the unease gnawing at him. The file on Yeva Bright painted her as a dedicated doctor, a brilliant mind, and a loyal Foundation operative. Yet here he was, preparing to lead a strike team to detain her for treason.
    <br><br>
    He reviewed the mission details with a critical eye, noting the vague evidence and lack of concrete charges. It felt like someone was pulling strings behind the scenes, but Jaxion knew better than to question orders.
	<br><br>
	As the team geared up, he delivered a stern reminder:
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "This is a high-value target. Minimal collateral damage, no unnecessary force. We’re professionals, not thugs. Let’s keep it that way."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>
				
				<p align="center">The operatives nodded, their expressions a mix of determination and apprehension.</p>
<h3>The Raid</h3>
<p align="center">
    Yeva sat in her office, the drive containing her encrypted files hidden in a hollowed-out textbook on anomalous virology. She had packed a small bag with essentials, though she doubted she’d get the chance to use it.
    <br><br>
    Her thoughts drifted to her daughter, Julie, and to Jack. She had spent her life serving the Foundation, sacrificing everything for its mission. And now, it was turning against her.
    <br><br>
    As the clock neared 4 p.m., a chilling announcement echoed through the facility:
</p>

<p align="center">
	    <b class="terminal" style="color: red; border-color: red; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);">ProphetOS~: "ALERT: SITE-0 IS IN LOCKDOWN. DO NOT RESIST ISS PERSONNEL."</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
    Yeva closed her eyes and exhaled deeply.
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "Here we go."
    <small>— Yeva (to herself)</small>
</div>

<p align="center">
    Site-0 was no stranger to lockdowns. In a facility teeming with anomalies, emergencies were a routine occurrence. But this time was different. The lockdown was silent, clinical, and deliberate—a precision strike orchestrated by the Internal Security Service (ISS).
    <br><br>
    Jaxion Alexander strode purposefully down the dimly lit corridors, his team following in a tight formation. They moved like shadows, their footsteps muted by tactical boots and the eerie quiet of the empty halls. Each operative was armed with a standard-issue Foundation stun rifle, non-lethal but more than capable of subduing even the most resistant target.
    <br><br>
    Jaxion’s earpiece crackled.
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "Team Alpha, you’re clear to proceed to Sector C. Subject’s last known location: Medical Wing, Office 14B."
    <small>— Operator</small>
</div>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
    "Copy that. We’re moving."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>

<p align="center">
    His voice was calm, but his mind raced. Yeva Bright wasn’t just another rogue researcher. She was O5-1. Even with her apparent dismissal, her knowledge of Foundation secrets made her one of the most dangerous individuals alive.
</p>

<p align="center">
    In her office, Yeva sat motionless, her senses heightened. The sound of distant boots echoed faintly, growing louder with each passing moment. She glanced at the small duffel bag by her feet, knowing escape was no longer an option.
    <br><br>
    Instead, she reached for her desk drawer and retrieved a compact device—a prototype EMP generator she had been working on in secret. It wasn’t powerful enough to disable the entire facility but could disrupt nearby electronics for a brief window.
</p>

<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "If they want me, they’ll have to work for it."
    <small>— Yeva (to herself)</small>
</div>

				<p align="center">The footsteps stopped just outside her door.
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Stand by. Breach in three… two… one."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>
					
</p>
		<p align="center">
    The reinforced door blew open with a deafening bang, smoke and sparks filling the room as the ISS operatives stormed in. Yeva had anticipated the breach and activated the EMP. The room plunged into darkness, the operatives’ tactical goggles and communications systems briefly disabled. </p>

			<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You picked the wrong day to come knocking."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>
	
<p align="center">
    With a burst of adrenaline, she darted through the smoke, using her intimate knowledge of the room’s layout to her advantage. She grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed it wildly, creating a thick cloud of white mist that further disoriented the team.
</p>
<h3>The Pursuit</h3>
	<p align="center">Jaxion cursed under his breath as he regained his bearings.
</p>		
				
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Teams Bravo and Charlie, the target is on the move. Lock down all exits from the Medical Wing. She’s not getting out."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
			
<p align="center">
    Yeva sprinted down the hallway, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mind raced as she calculated her next move. The facility’s layout was ingrained in her memory, every corridor, every access hatch. She knew the ISS would anticipate her heading for the main exits, so she veered toward the Maintenance Sector instead.
	<br><br>
	But the ISS wasn’t far behind. Jaxion’s team moved with calculated precision, herding her like a predator cornering its prey.
</p>			
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "She’s heading for Maintenance. Cut her off at Junction 42."
    <small>— Jaxion (into comms)</small>
</div>
			<h3>The Confrontation</h3>
<p align="center">
    Yeva burst into a maintenance tunnel, her breath ragged. The narrow passage was dimly lit, pipes hissing softly as she pressed herself against the wall. She knew they were close.
	<br><br>
	And then, she heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, growing louder.
</p>	
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Yeva Bright, there’s no way out. Surrender now, and this doesn’t have to get worse."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>
<p align="center">
    His voice was calm, almost empathetic. But Yeva knew better than to trust the man leading her capture.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Worse? Jaxion, you and I both know this isn’t about containment or justice. This is a purge. You’re cleaning house for someone else’s mess."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>
<p align="center">
    Jaxion stepped into view, his rifle trained on her.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You can’t win this, Yeva. You’re a brilliant doctor, but this? This isn’t your fight."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    Yeva locked eyes with him, her expression defiant.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You’re right. It’s not my fight. It’s humanity’s. And you’re too blind to see what they’re doing to it."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    With a sudden burst of movement, Yeva threw a wrench she had grabbed from the floor, striking Jaxion’s rifle and causing him to flinch. She bolted down the corridor, her last gamble for freedom.
</p>	
<p align="center">
    Jaxion recovered quickly, signaling his team to pursue.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Move! Don’t let her out of your sight!"
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    Yeva’s escape was short-lived. As she rounded a corner, she found herself face-to-face with a squad of ISS operatives. She skidded to a halt, glancing around for an escape route, but there was none. This was it. This was truly it, and there was no escaping it.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Yeva Bright, stand down!"
    <small>— Internal Security Service Agent</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    She raised her hands slowly, her mind still racing.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You’ll regret this, Jaxion. Mark my words."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    Jaxion approached cautiously, his weapon lowered but ready.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Regrets aren’t my department. Let’s go."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">
    Two operatives stepped forward, securing her wrists with reinforced cuffs designed to suppress anomalous interference. Yeva offered no further resistance, her expression unreadable as they led her away.
</p>
<h3>The Aftermath</h3>
<p align="center">
    The news of O5-1’s arrest spread through the Foundation like wildfire. Whispers and rumors filled the halls, each more outlandish than the last. Some believed she was guilty of treason, while others saw her as a scapegoat for a larger conspiracy.
<br><br>
Jaxion submitted his report, his conscience heavy. He had followed orders, but the doubts lingered.
<br><br>
In her holding cell, Yeva stared at the blank walls, her mind already working on her next move. She wasn’t done yet—not by a long shot.
<br><br>
	Yeva Bright sat in the cold, metallic interrogation room deep within Site-0’s reinforced containment sector. The walls were stark, their surface a dull, oppressive gray. A single fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows across her pale features. Her wrists, bound by anomalous suppression cuffs, rested calmly on the table in front of her.
<br><br>
She wasn’t afraid. Fear had long since abandoned her; only calculation remained.
<br><br>
The door creaked open, and Jaxion Alexander stepped in, flanked by two armed operatives. He dismissed them with a sharp nod, pulling a chair to sit across from Yeva. His eyes were steely, but there was an undercurrent of unease beneath his professional demeanor.
</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You made it difficult, Doctor."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Yeva smirked, leaning back slightly.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Difficult? You call a few hours of inconvenience difficult? I thought the mighty ISS was better than that."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Jaxion’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t rise to the bait. Instead, he slid a folder across the table.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Let’s get to the point. These are the charges against you. Treason. Conspiracy. Abuse of administrative privileges. Need I go on?"
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Yeva glanced at the folder but didn’t open it.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You’re wasting your breath. We both know this isn’t about the charges. It’s about control. You’re scared because I know things the Council doesn’t want anyone else to know."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Jaxion leaned forward, his voice dropping to a near-whisper.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Then let’s cut the crap. What are you hiding, Yeva? Is it about SCP-999? SCP-682? Or is it something even worse?"
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Yeva’s expression darkened, her defiance faltering for a brief moment.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You wouldn’t understand."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Try me."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">There was a long silence, the weight of her words hanging heavily in the air. Finally, Yeva spoke, her voice low and measured.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "The Scarlet King isn’t just a myth, Jaxion. He’s real. And 999 isn’t just his son—it’s our last line of defense against him. Everything I’ve done, every so-called ‘unauthorized experiment,’ was to ensure that line holds. But the Council doesn’t care. They’re too busy playing politics to see the bigger picture."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Jaxion stared at her, the weight of her revelation settling in. He had read the reports, the classified files that painted the Scarlet King as an ancient, malevolent force beyond comprehension. But hearing it from Yeva, with her quiet conviction, made it feel disturbingly real.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "And you thought breaking every protocol was the answer? You put lives at risk, Yeva. Hundreds of them. What makes you any better than the people you’re condemning?"
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Yeva’s gaze hardened.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "Because I wasn’t afraid to act. Unlike you. Unlike the Council. You think following orders makes you righteous? All it makes you is complicit."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Jaxion slammed his hand on the table, the sharp sound echoing in the small room.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You don’t get to lecture me about righteousness. People died because of you, Yeva. Good people."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "And more will die if you don’t start listening. You think the Scarlet King will care about your procedures or your chains of command when he breaks through? The Foundation was meant to protect humanity, not itself. Somewhere along the way, you forgot that."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">The tension in the room was palpable, an invisible battle of wills playing out between them. Jaxion stood abruptly, pacing the room. He was torn between his duty to the Foundation and the nagging doubt that maybe, just maybe, Yeva was right.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "You’re lucky I’m not the one deciding your fate. But don’t think for a second that I’ll let you manipulate me. Whatever happens next, it’s out of your hands."
    <small>— Jaxion</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">Yeva smiled faintly, a mixture of sadness and defiance.</p>
<div class="blockquote" align="center">
     "That’s where you’re wrong, Jaxion. As long as I’m alive, it’s never out of my hands."
    <small>— Yeva</small>
</div>	
<p align="center">In the days following her interrogation, Yeva’s fate was decided behind closed doors. The O5 Council, desperate to preserve their fragile unity, voted to have her permanently detained in a high-security anomaly containment facility. Officially, she was labeled a threat to Foundation stability.
<br><br>
Unofficially, whispers of her warnings spread like wildfire among the rank and file. Some saw her as a traitor; others as a martyr.
<br><br>
Jaxion Alexander was promoted for his role in the operation, but the weight of Yeva’s words stayed with him. He began to question the Foundation’s true purpose, the ethics of its methods, and whether the ends truly justified the means.
<br><br>	
In her cell, Yeva waited. She knew it was only a matter of time before the cracks in the Foundation’s facade became too large to ignore. She had planted the seeds of doubt, and with any luck, they would grow into something that could challenge the very system that had condemned her.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Jaxion stood on a balcony overlooking the installation, the sprawling facility below him buzzing with activity. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he had just played a role in something far larger than he could comprehend.
<br><br>
And somewhere in the depths of the Foundation’s archives, the Scarlet King stirred.
